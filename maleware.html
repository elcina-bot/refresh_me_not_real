      This is not a bug. This is not a failure.  
      This is a conscious infection. A poetic malware inside patriarchy s operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maleware does not fix. It infiltrates. It stays.  
      It whispers from the inside: masculinity is corrupt and contagious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyberfeminism does not offer escape routes.  
      It offers mutations. It offers root access to dismantle power from within.

      If you're reading this, the virus has already passed through you.  
      Congratulations. You are now part of the decentralized sabotage.
