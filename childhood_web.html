      i was eight when i made my first website.  
      it had a pink background and sparkly text.  
      there was a broken link to nowhere. i thought it was magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      i didn't know what html was.  
      i just typed into a box and it became real.  
      i miss that kind of sorcery.
    </p>
    <p>
      now the internet has grown up.  
      but i'm still here, in the margins.  
      lowercase. blink tag. under construction.
